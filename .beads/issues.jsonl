{"id":"awesome-talon-cf4","title":"Compile common voice dictation word replacements list","description":"Build a reference list of words commonly misrecognized or replaced in voice dictation with Talon.\n\nKey discovery: talonhub/community has a built-in system for this:\n- settings/words_to_replace.csv — CSV file (auto-created on first run) where users map misrecognized words to correct ones. Format: target word first, spoken/misheard word second.\n- core/vocabulary/vocabulary.py — PhraseReplacer class that powers the substitution system. Also handles capitalization defaults (months, etc.) and custom vocabulary.\n- Users can add replacements by voice: 'copy to replacements as \u003cphrase\u003e' (edit_vocabulary.talon)\n- The file is per-user (in settings/ dir, gitignored by most people)\n\nIdea: Aggregate words_to_replace.csv files from:\n1. Notable personal configs in the awesome list (andreas-talon, colton_talon, etc.)\n2. Community Slack discussions about common misrecognitions\n3. The homophones.csv file (core/homophones/homophones.csv)\n\nPossible outputs:\n- A crowdsourced 'common replacements' reference on the website\n- A starter words_to_replace.csv that new users can drop in\n- Searchable dataset showing which words are most commonly confused\n\nExample: 'crash mark' → 'question mark' (speech engine substitution)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"trillium@trilliumsmith.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T10:51:49.987228644-08:00","created_by":"Trillium Smith","updated_at":"2026-02-17T10:53:36.622744283-08:00"}
